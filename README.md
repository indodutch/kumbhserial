Python 3 implementation for extracting data from devices in Kumbh Mela with a serial device driver.

## Installation ##

Use virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper to set up a suitable Python 3.4 or 3.5 environment.

Install the project with

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage ##

To read out the data from the download devices, run:

```shell
kumbhdownload
```
Use `kumbhdownload -h` to see usage information. In particular, use the `-J` option to disable the parser and only write raw text.
Unless otherwise specified, the binary data ends up in the `data/raw/processed` and the JSON data ends up in the `data/detections` and `data/system` directories.

To use read out the time from the sniffer, run:

```shell
kumbhsniffer
```
Unless otherwise specified, sniffer JSON data ends up in the `data/sniffer` directory.

To process any unprocessed files, run `kumbhprocessor`.

To read the Thinture GPS devices with `kumbhgps`. Again, see the options with `-h` flag.
